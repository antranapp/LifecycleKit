LifecycleKit is a framework for building lifecycle-aware architecture components.

Inspired by [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/ribs) and [Android Jetpack Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle).
Complemented by [Needle](https://github.com/uber/needle), a compile-time safe Swift dependency injection framework.

## Overview

[Lifecycle](https://github.com/ashare80/LifecycleKit/wiki/Lifecycle) provides protocols and implementations that can be used to facilitate building safe and scalable application architecture.

[SPIR](https://github.com/ashare80/LifecycleKit/wiki/SPIR) is an app architecture utilizing Lifecycle to create a scoped business logic tree independent of the view hierarchy.
